            <h1>How to meditate</h1>
            <p class="mt-1" style="color: grey; font-size: 21px; ">Meditation is something everyone can do, here’s how.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-1" style="font-size: 20px;">How do you learn to meditate? In mindfulness meditation, we’re
                learning how to pay attention to the
                breath as it goes in and out, and notice when the mind wanders from this task. This practice of
                returning to the breath builds the muscles of attention and mindfulness.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-1" style="font-size: 20px;">
                When we pay attention to our breath, we are learning how to return to, and remain in, the present
                moment—to
                anchor ourselves in the here and now on purpose, without judgement.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-1">
                1) Take a seat
                Find place to sit that feels calm and quiet to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                2) Set a time limit
                If you’re just beginning, it can help to choose a short time, such as five or 10 minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                3) Notice your body
                You can sit in a chair with your feet on the floor, you can sit loosely cross-legged, you can kneel—all
                are fine. Just make sure you are stable and in a position you can stay in for a while.
            </p>
            <p>
                4) Feel your breath
                Follow the sensation of your breath as it goes in and as it goes out.
            </p>
            <p>
                5) Notice when your mind has wandered
                Inevitably, your attention will leave the breath and wander to other places. When you get around to
                noticing that your mind has wandered—in a few seconds, a minute, five minutes—simply return your
                attention to the breath.
            </p>
            <p>

                6) Be kind to your wandering mind
                Don’t judge yourself or obsess over the content of the thoughts you find yourself lost in. Just come
                back.
            </p>
            <p>
                7) Close with kindness
                When you’re ready, gently lift your gaze (if your eyes are closed, open them). Take a moment and notice
                any sounds in the environment. Notice how your body feels right now. Notice your thoughts and emotions.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s it! That’s the practice. You focus your attention, your mind wanders, you bring it back, and you
                try to do it as kindly as possible (as many times as you need to).
